# A Min-Heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is
# smaller than or equal to the values in the children of that node. Mapping the elements
# of a heap into an array is trivial: if a node is stored an index k, then its left
# child is stored at index 2k + 1 and its right child at index 2k + 2.
