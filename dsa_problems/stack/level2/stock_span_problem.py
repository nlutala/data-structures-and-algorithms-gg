    The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of N daily
    price quotes for a stock and we need to calculate the span of the stockâ€™s price for
    all N days. The span Si of the stockâ€™s price on a given day i is defined as the
    maximum number of consecutive days just before the given day, for which the price of
    the stock on the current day is less than or equal to its price on the given day.\n

    :param - n (an integer)\n
    :param - prices (a list of integers)\n

    Returns a list of integers denoting the stock span.
