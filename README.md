# data-structures-and-algorithms-gg
Going through data structures and algorithms as seen on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/learn-data-structures-and-algorithms-dsa-tutorial/

To run the tests, it works better if you can configure this in Visual code. I have left the .vscode folder to help with this.
